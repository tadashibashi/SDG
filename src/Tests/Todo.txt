Tests todo:

- Test Gamepad with a real gamepad, in Sandbox.
- SpriteRenderer
    - How to load Sprites in a self-contained way?
        They need Frames, which depend on Texture references; use shared_ptr instead?
        This would enable resources to finally unload when there are no more references.
        Prevent broken references.



Sandbox tests:
- Graphics
    x RenderTarget
    x Font
    x Shader
    x SpriteBatch
    x Texture





Finished:
x Exceptions

- Graphics
    x Window
- Input (can't really automate tests effectively unless there's a
         way to use automated input. Use Sandbox to test.)
