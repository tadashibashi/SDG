/*!
 * @file Ref.h â€“ SDG_Engine
 * @namespace SDG
 * @class Ref / CRef
 * A reference to another object that behaves like a pointer.
 * You can get the internal pointer by calling Ref::Get()
 * It was designed for safety against accidental copying during ref retrieval,
 * and helping remember who owns what. It also has a uniform interface,
 * as opposed to cpp references using dot accessors, and pointers using arrows.
 * Ref simply uses pointer arrows.
 * Finally, CRef is a Ref where the internal reference is const.
 * You could write Ref<const T>, but CRef<T> seems more compact.
 *
 * Limitations: since void is not referencable, you can't have a Ref<void> object.
 * This is the cost of having a template constructor that accepts references.
 * In this case, an alternative would be to store Ref<void *> 
 * (calling Get() will retrieve a pointer to void pointer in this case)
 * or cast the void * to a uintptr_t to store in the Ref.
 *
 * Warning: Ref<T> does not guarantee a valid pointer.
 * Therefore, it is a good idea to design the application in a way where
 * any object with a Ref is guaranteed to go out of scope before the
 * referenced object does. Otherwise, a Shared<T> may possibly be a
 * better solution.
