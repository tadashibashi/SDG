TODO:
- Test SpriteRenderer
- Text Renderer
x Audio FMOD
    - works in HTML5

- Tile layer rendering
- Tiled Map loading
- Static (blit to a texture target once) and dynamic tile maps (blits every time a change occurs)
- Finish Window initialization flags manual set, or see why SDL_gpu sets a weird fullscreen when setting flags directly
- Game system features (used in subclasses of App)
    - Entity
    - Entity Pooling
    - Sprite renderer, animation
    - Scene System
    - Make Asteroids Game as you assemble these systems
- imgui integration

- Figure out cause of fullscreen/non-fullscreen matrix projection discrepancy. HTML5 zooms in vs Desktop
    There's an SDL function for controlling the behavior of resolution on new screen
    I forgot what it is though...
    This fixed itself after cleaning up matrix functions. It may or may not pop up again since the problem wasn't diagnosed.

Notes:
Plan is to create basic useful components to be inherited by Component objects

Future:
- allow user to specify desired input types in the config.
- Gui app for creating and previewing animations from atlas
- Create a minimal repro case of multi-Window close bug, and upstream to Github. (doesn't affect Windows...)

Done:
x Create Mouse object to capture mouse clicks and position
    (use old sdg-engine for ref)
x Test Font in Sandbox
x File Reading / Writing
x Test Camera2D in action
x Texture
