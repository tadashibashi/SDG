C++ Standard 17

===== Includes ================================================================
Order - alphabetical order in these groupings:
  - Local includes
  - SDG_Engine includes
  - 3rd party includes
  - Std includes

Quotes are used for local includes. 
A path is considered "local" if it is in the same folder or nested
deeper in the same subfolder. Otherwise, literal paths are preferred.
Angled subpaths stemming from src/ or lib/ for everything else.

Example:
#include "MyClass.h"
#include "Private/Hidden.h"

#include <SDG/Math/Vector2.h>
#include <SDG/Ref.h>

#include <tinyxml2.h>

#include <vector>

===== Header files ============================================================
Should begin with "#pragma once", instead of include guards to keep symbols
from becoming cluttered.

Regular SDG_Engine and other library header file names should end with ".h"

"Super header" files, which end with ".hpp" will be created for the end-user.
They should include each relevant header file within that "module" or section
of the library.
One master header, "SDG.hpp" will include each of these super header files.

===== Implementation ==========================================================
Use pImpl idiom to keep the SDL_gpu/SDL headers out of the SDG header files.
- Make sure to initialize variables in the Impl struct in the constructor.

An object containing a raw pointer signifies that that object owns it and must
must handle memory management for it. A Ref will be used to signify a reference
to another object's object.
